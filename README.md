# sampleextension-cpp
A sample extension for Tcl using C++ and SWIG (TEA extension)

This repo is a testcase to add C++ support for the official sampleextension & tclconfig 
and should eventually be pushed upstream to tclconfig/sampleextension located here

* https://core.tcl-lang.org/sampleextension
* https://core.tcl-lang.org/tclconfig

I don't plan long-term maintenance once the porting is done (started in July 2021)
